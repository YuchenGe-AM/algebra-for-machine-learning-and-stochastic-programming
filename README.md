3. 'Compu_3.ipynb' and 'Compu_4.ipynb': applications of Grobner Basis and Graver Basis to Stochastic Integer Programming.
4. 'Compu_5.ipynb': lagrange relaxation.
5. 'Algsto.pdf' and 'Algsto2.pdf': final reports containing theorems determing the relationships between Groebner and Graver Basis of IP and SIP and new algorithms in integer programming especially favorable to stochastic integer programming.
6. 'Programmes' folder: realization of some algorithms including computation of Toric Ideal, Graver Basis and new algorithms in integer programming especially favorable to stochastic integer programming.
7. 'Alg_1 Graver2Augmentation.ipynb': computation of Toric Ideal and Graver Basis of a matrix; augmentation algorithm.
