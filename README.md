The reports and codes for the project on algebraic geometry methods (Grobner and Graver Basis) to introduce algorithms and reduce the computational cost of  Integer Programming and Stochastic Integer Programming under the supervision of Prof. Janosch Ortmann and Prof. Walter Rei at UQAM.

Detail:

1.  Sympy Package for Algebra  ( https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html ; https://mattpap.github.io/masters-thesis/html/index.html ).
2. 'Compu_1.ipynb' and 'Compu_2.ipynb' recalls some facts from Grobner Basis and some basic application to classical commutative algebra theory and integer programming.
3. 'Compu_3.ipynb' and 'Compu_4.ipynb' are some applications of Grobner Basis to Stochastic Integer Programming.
4. 'Compu_5.ipynb' introduces the famous lagrange relaxation.
5. 'Algsto.pdf' and 'Algsto2.pdf'  are the final reports.
6. The realization of some algorithms are in the 'Programmes' folder including computation of Toric Ideal, Graver Basis and new algorithms in integer programming especially favorable to stochastic integer programming.
