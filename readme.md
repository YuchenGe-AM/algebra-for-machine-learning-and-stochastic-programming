The notes for the project on algebraic geometry methods to underpin Integer Programming and Stochastic Integer Programming under the supervision of Prof. Janosch Ortmann and Prof. Walter Rei from UQAM.

1.  Sympy Package for Algebra  (https://mattpap.github.io/masters-thesis/html/index.html).
2. 'Compu_1.ipynb' recalls some facts from Grobner Basis and some basic application to classical commutative algebra theory.
3. 'Compu_2.ipynb' and 'Compu_3.ipynb' are the first week report.
4. 'Compu_4.ipynb' is the second week report.
5. The realization of some algorithms in the 'Programmes' file.
