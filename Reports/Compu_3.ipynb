    "Applying Grobner bases to solve integer linear programs was first proposed in $[2]$. It yields additional information at a possibly high computational cost, so that usually it is an inefficient method to solve the problem for a fixed right-hand side. However, the additional information turns out to be highly beneficial when an integer linear program needs to be solved many times, where each time only the right-hand side parameters are different. Therefore, this method does seem particularly useful for solving stochastic programs with integer recourse. "
